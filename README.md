ModJam #2
=======

This is the repo for the mod I am making for ModJam #2, currently the mod has the following features:
- A block that can only be broken by the player who placed it
- A block that manages the security in four forms, passcode, keycard, retina and redstone(not very secure but better red than dead)

Plans for bonus points:
=======
[X] You get a bonus point for not using any GUI in the mod
[X] You get a bonus point for making a non-tech themed mod
[>] You get a bonus point for ignoring all other bonuses listed here
